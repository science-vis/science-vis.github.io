    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nI am not choosing fields but values, I am following interests, curiosity, and purpose. I am somewhere on the overlap of biology, medicine, and data science. I had diverse experiences in different fields learning my lessons which resulted not only in a diverse skill set and a story to tell but a vision of how to do (and not to do) whatever I am up to next.\nI am most proud of some projects that were not a part of my job but a passion I had luxury and stubbornness to follow, boldness to create, and perseverance to lead to the finish.\nI care about biomedical science, translational research, scientific integrity, open science, and honest data analysis and representation. My technical gems are cell culture, RNA things, and ggplot graphs :)\nCurrently open for work.\nI am looking for a new challenge. Biomedical research, data science, computational bio. Preferably open science projects relevant to health challenges (cardiovascular and neuro are the closest to me but open to other fields as well). I really want to be a part of the team work no matter the size of the team but quality, common values, and purpose. I will bring skills in wet lab, data science, problem-solving of all kinds, bridging interdisciplinary teams, addiction to learn, set up and improve workflows.\nIdeas or propositions?
