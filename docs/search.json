    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nI am that person that would know many random things in several fields (mostly, life sciences, medicine, data science) and for entire life is torn between the beauty of fundamental cutting-edge research and being useful here and now.\nI am particularly passionate about creative and efficient ways to analyze and visualize complex data, to critically assess and challenge data to get meaningful and honest answers. I am a (selective) learning addict. Love to solve problems of different kinds and tackle tricky things. Found making lists of things I am afraid of and all of a sudden finding myself digging into that field.\nEnjoy being useful to the team and to the world. Even when being socially awkward I do need to be useful.\nI grew up and spent most of my life in Ukraine (Support Ukraine!). Since 2018 you can find me in Utah. Who knows where to next.\nFor the longest time, science, organizing conferences, and playing with programming languages were my biggest hobbies but I decided to dig out crochet from my childhood and for last 5 years crocheting on and off. Microcrochet is my recent obsession and you can check out some works on the hobbies page.\nCurrently open for work.\nThere were some critical events that shifted my identity from being a scientist to being a person who loves science and would transfer into more “useful here and now” role. Would love to follow my heart and work with data of different flavors and apply tidyverse and shiny magic. Medicine or life sciences related? It’s a plus as it is where I know most of (not so) random things. Includes both healthcare data and genomics, RNA biology, and single-cell biology? Yes, please. An opportunity to focus on the data but also contribute to wet lab, teach, help building a new startup/lab/department/company? That is a dream.\nWhere? Anywhere where it is safe, good schools, and I can support my family of 3 humans and 2 furry friends.\nIdeas or propositions?
